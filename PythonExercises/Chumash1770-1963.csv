i and died in the midst of that duty.
""For over 30 years.” said Mr. Adkins.

j to the public service and for nearly 20
i years of that time in judicial duties.
I He was a brave soldier, a capable ex
i ecutive and an able Judge. Both bench
J and bar greatly loved him. He was
! an unusual man possessing those at
tributes that endeared him to all that
| him. In his death the people of
j the District of Columbia lose & great
’ friend.”
1 The lawyer said he was so shocked
at. the death of Justice Smith that his
j heart was too full to give proper utter
ance to his feelings.
“In the passing of Justice Smith.”
S said Justice Siddons. “the court not only
j loses a very able judge, but a very dear
j friend in the full meaning of that term.
: He rendered Invaluable assistance to
| the court in disposing, of its heavy
| docket. He possessed a high character
and a firm conviction. His work in his
! chosen profession was a pleasure to him
; and he endeared himself to all In his
personal and family relations. He was
! firmly grounded in his religious convic
tion of the life beyond the grave and
approached the end without the least
misgivings of its reality.”

NEW LANGLEY HIGH
PRINCIPAL SWORN
Chester H. Holmes Inspects
Building With Supt.
Ballou.
Chester H. Holmes of Holyoke. Mass.,
i who was appointed June 21 by the
Board of Education to be principal of
1 the Langley Junior High School, was
I sworn in as a member of the District
:of Columbia school system personnel
jat Franklin Administration Building
j this morning.
Following the taking of his oath of
I office in the office of the secretary of
I the Board of Education. Mr. Holmes
j went to the Langley Building with Dr
Frank W. Ballou, superintendent of
j schools, to take charge formally. G.
Derwood Baker, retiring principal, who
resigned to return to his home in Cali
fornia, relinquished his command and
after viewing the building with Mr.
Baker, Mr. Holmes went directly to
Union Station, where he boarded a
train for Holyoke shortly after 11
o’clock.
Mr. Holmes’ official term begins July
1, he said this morning, but he has
been given leave of absence, effective
immediately, so that he might teach in
the Summer sessions at the University
of Maine.
Coming to Washington a stranger to
the city and its educational system, Mr.
Holmes said he planned merely to slip
into his new position and carry forward
! the plans instituted by Mr. Baker. He
is bringing no ideas for radical changes,
he said, but simply a determination to
• learn” his assignment and give to It
his best abilities.
Mr. Holmes was graduated from Har
vard University in 1916, returning to
take his master degree in the graduate
school in 1924. He comes to Washing
ton from Holyoke, where he has been
principal of the Morgan Junior High
School since 1925.
TRADE COMMISSION
SUMMONED BY COURT
Must Show Why Mandamus Should
Not Be Issued in Baking
Powder Case.
Justice Jennings Bailey of the District
of Columbia Supreme Court today j
issued a rule on the Federal Trade
Commission to show cause July 12 why
a writ of mandamus should not be
issued against the members of the
commission to require them to pass
upon and announce decision on the
petitions of the Royal Baking Powder
Co. in the form of affidavits of prejudice
against William E. Humphrey', a mem
ber of the commission.
The company complained that Hum
phrey gave out information relative to
its pcition and made speeches antago
nistic to the interests of the company.
It tells the court that the refusal or
neglect of the commission to pass upon
and decide promptly the question of
prejudice will deny the company’s right
to orderly procedure and may result in
findings of fact which will be deter
mined in part by a commissioner, “who
has shown bias, prejudice and positive
antagonism"" to the company. The
commission by postponing until final
hearing its decision on the prejudice
charge, is acting arbitrarily and unlaw
fully, it is charged.

Commerce is now in the process of being established.
National vice-president of the
group, Benjamin Cooper, is in
Miami now meeting with local
civic leaders to formulate basic
plans and within three weeks
they expect to meet with the local
chambers of commerce to discuss
cooperative work in connectioif
with stimulating trade between
America and Israel and “to final
ly do away with charitable drives
here for Israel.”
' Guest of honor at the tradition
,al Pace Setter's dinner of the
combined Jewish' Appeal was
Golda Myerson, Minister of Labor

Release of Nazis Shames
U. S. State Dept.
(Continued from Page 1)
U. S. soldiers throughout the
world expressed indignation. The
leading non-official military pub
lication voiced a typical criticism
of the State Department. Speak
ing for the “Army Times,” the
“old sergeant” commented: “If
fate works it out that some day I
cross paths with that upstanding
representative of the SS, I’m go
ing to invoke the law of eye for
an eye, and Gen. Dietrich will pay
the price for what he did, pay it
full and pay it slow. And if the
power politicking boys want to
hang me for it, OK. I’ve been
getting it in the neck from the
diplomat gang for 40 years so
once more won’t matter.”
Tempers still soared over the
Dietrich parole when word came
that Plitt was working to free SS
Colonel Joachim Peiper, Diet
rich's ""trigger man"" at Malmedy.
Peiper, like Dietrich, was origi
nally sentenced to death. Jewish
groups recalled Peiper as com
mander of the ""blow torch"" bat
talion which burned Jews and
other civilians on the Eastern
front.
In Columbus, Ohio, a 33-year
old veteran spoke out. He was
Virgil P. Lary, the only U. S. of
ficer to survive the mass murder
of sick and wounded American

prisoners at Malmedy. The re
lease of Peiper, he said, would
“dishonor” the 160 Americans
murdered there.
Lary. a first lieutenant, said
""the screams of my men who
were massacred . . . still ring in
my ears . . . For those of us who
survive,"" he said, ""our hearts are
sick after each release. Os the 75
tried and 34 receiving the death
sentence, now only Peiper re
mains to answer. Sepp Dietrich
has been set free and now his
personal officer directly responsi
ble is to be released.""
Lary told how he could still
hear the cries of his comrades
“and more so now that our coun
try has lost every vestige of honor
for them ...”
A Stale Department official in
Washington looked across his
desk and said that this was 1956
and that ""sentimentality"" must be
forgotten. He pointed to a New
York Times headline. It said
""West German Soldiers Arrive; 38
Bonn Army Men Here For Train
ing."" But the Times story con
tained a line to which the Stale
Department man did not point.
This line said ""All had been of
ficers in Hitler's Army and all
had seen combat at various front
lines.""
